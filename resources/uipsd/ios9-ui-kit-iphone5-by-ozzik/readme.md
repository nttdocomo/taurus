(Howdy and thanks for downloading this UI kit!)


# Notice
Obviously the design of iOS is Apple's so I don't claim anything about it :>

Yet, creating this kit wasn't an easy task so please be a nice person and don't go selling it, distribute it again, claim its yours or any other bad stuff.

The squircles in this kit are the fine work of Marc Edwards (http://bjango.com)!


# Changelog

## Version 3.0 (September 21st, 2015)

### General
- Now having dedicated versions of the kit for each device - iPhone 5, 6 and 6 Plus - saving you the trouble of constantly stretching elements. All three versions are available at http://ozzik.co/freebies/ios9kit

### What's New
- Home screen now includes default app icons for more realistic mocks
